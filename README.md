# Introduction

This is The Reef. A buy/sell/trade/services forum-type web application for aquarists in my local area. The area I am in has a bunch of aquarists, but no dedicated buy/sell/trade application that people can use to get in touch with other hobbyists

---

# Objectives

To build a full stack forum-type web application with user logins, authentication and the ability to have unique profiles. I wanted this app to be a place where fellow aquarists could hangout, discuss anything aquatic and of course buy/sell/trade items

---

# Who is this for? 

Aquarists in my local area (Niagara)

---

# Optimizations 

  These are some of the optimizations I am in the midst of implementing into my project given the time.
  
- Add Google Auth (on top of Passport which is currently functional)
- General optimizations for progressive rendering
- Add more responsiveness for mobile devices/tablets/smaller screens
- Add some type of private messaging

---

# Tech used 

JavaScript, MongoDB, Express, Node, CSS, EJS, Passport, Bootstrap5

---

# Packages/Dependencies used
